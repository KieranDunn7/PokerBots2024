Min raise: 6
Max raise: 150



For changing raise strategy:
    Raises on flop, turn, river
    - Make sure they aren't just high raising so we fold
    Cards after each hand and opponent hand strengths
    Whether opponent wins based on rounds they bet on and whether they had the hand we were afraid of



Preflop:
    Big Blind:
        Win % reqd for raising after opponent calls: 0.58
            Raise amount: 1.38*pot_size (or min/max_raise)

    Small Blind:
        Win % reqd for raising on small blind: 0.56
            Raise amount: 1.27*pot_size (or min/max_raise)

    Win % for reraise: 0.54 + pot_size/100
        Raise amount: (0.54 + pot_size/100)/(1 - (0.54 + pot_size/100)) * pot_size (or min/max_raise)

    Win % for fold: < 0.62 AND pct*pot_size < (1-pct) * continue_cost
